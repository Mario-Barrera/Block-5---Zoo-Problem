                <p>Polar bear, (Ursus maritimus), great white northern bear (family Ursidae) found throughout the Arctic region. The polar bear travels long distances over vast desolate expanses, generally on drifting oceanic ice floes, searching for seals, its primary prey. The polar bear is the largest and most powerful carnivore on land, a title it shares with a subspecies of brown bear called the Kodiak bear. It has no natural predators and knows no fear of humans, making it an extremely dangerous animal. <a href="https://polarbearsinternational.org/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The American black bear (Ursus americanus), or simply black bear, is a species of medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. It is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location. It typically lives in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. <a href="https://www.activewild.com/american-black-bear/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America. Of the land carnivorans, it is rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females. The fur ranges in color from cream to reddish to dark brown. It has evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears, and paws up to 21 cm (8.3 in) wide and 36 cm (14 in) long, to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/brown-bear-facts-4175063" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The Kordofan giraffe (Giraffa antiquorum or Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum) is a species or subspecies of giraffe found in northern Cameroon, southern Chad, the Central African Republic, and possibly western Sudan. They usually live in tree savannas, bush savannas and thorn savannas. Compared to most other subspecies, the Kordofan giraffe is relatively small at 3.8 to 4.7 meters, with more irregular spots on the inner legs. There are around 2,300 individuals living in the wild. In the wild, female Kordofan giraffes live in loose groups, whilst males live solitary. They have an average lifespan of around 35 years. <a href="https://animalia.bio/kordofan-giraffe" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan. It is currently extinct in the wild of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt and Eritrea. The Nubian giraffe used to be widespread in northeast Africa. The subspecies was listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN in 2018 for the first time due to a 95% decline in the past three decades. <a href="https://www.mammalage.com/nubian-giraffe/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>West African lions are a member of the Panthera leo subspecies of lion, which also includes Asiatic and Barbary. All three of these lions are very similar to each other, but they all have their own defining characteristics. The West African lion is arguably the most well-known of all the subspecies of lions. If you see a cartoon version of a lion or you are watching a film that has a lion in it, it is most likely to be depicted as a West African lion. In comparison to the Asiatic lion, the West African lion is much bigger. They have large manes, which they use as a defense mechanism and as a mating tactic. They also have incredibly sharp teeth they use to rip apart the flesh of their prey and they have deadly claws. <a href="https://worlddeer.org/west-african-lion-panthera-leo-senegalensis/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The Congo lion (Panthera leo azandica) is a lion subspecies native to Africa. Having a golden-yellow colored fur-covered body, they are truly the king of their habitat. Unlike other lions, the Congo lions prefer staying in the grasslands and open scrublands of Congo over the forests. Being keystone predators, these lions are heavy carnivorous eaters, capable of chasing, attacking, and preying on large and fleshy herbivorous animals like giraffes, zebras, African buffalos, deer, and other species. As these animals belong to the class of mammals, the female gives birth to one to four cubs per breeding season. <a href="https://worlddeer.org/congo-lion-panthera-leo-azandica/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The Transvaal lion is a huge cat with a long body and a big head. The male Transvaal lion usually has a well-developed mane, which is their most prominent feature. The females do not have manes. Transvaal lions possess yellow manes when they are young but the color darkens as they grow up, and becomes dark brown or black.  They are well developed for their hunting abilities. Transvaal lions have muscular rear legs, which help them in jumping, while their front legs are developed for trapping and seizing their prey. Transvaal lions acquire loose bellies that prevent them from getting seriously injured when attacked.  The overall body length of an adult Transvaal male is 2.6–3.2 m (8.5–10.5 ft) and the average size of a Transvaal female measures around 2.35–2.75 m (7.7–9.0 ft) not including their tails. <a href="https://worlddeer.org/transvaal-lion-habitat-behavior-conservation/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <li>Gelada <span>(left)</span></li>
                <p>The gelada, also famous as gelada baboon, is a species of monkeys that belong to the primate family Cercopithecidae (Old World Monkey). Although the geladas are closely related to baboons (genus Papio), they are not true baboons because they belong to the genus Theropithecus. They derive their nickname, the ‘bleeding-heart monkey’, from the brightly colored patch of skin that is shaped like an hourglass on its chest. The geladas are classified into two subspecies, including the northern gelada and southern or eastern gelada. They are, at present, found only in Ethiopia. Males are larger than females. The combined length of their head and body ranges between 19.7 in and 29.5 in (50 cm and 75 cm) for both sexes. They have a tail that can measure anywhere between 11.8 in and 19.7 in (30 cm and 50 cm). The males have an average weight of 40.8 lb (18.5 kg), while the females being smaller weigh less with an average weight of 24.3 lb (11 kg).  Their body is covered with dark brown or buff hair, while their face is dark with pale eyelids. They have black arms and feet, and a bright red, hourglass-shaped skin patch on their chest. <a href="https://www.primatespark.com/gelada-monkey/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The Vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) is an Old World monkey native to Africa. The term "vervet" is also used to refer to all the members of the genus Chlorocebus. These adorable monkeys live in social groups and involve their communication and alarm calls, specifically in regard to kin and group recognition, and particular predator sightings. The Vervet monkey is of medium to large size and has a black-tipped tail which is often longer than its body. Its fur is olive or gray, lighter on the underside. Its hands and feet are black, as are its ears and face. Its face has a white band above it, framed with white cheek tufts. Its arms and legs are long, about the same length as each other, to enable the monkey to walk with ease on all fours while on the ground, and this actually makes it quite speedy when running. The males tend to be bigger than the females. <a href="https://animalia.bio/vervet-monkey" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) is a baboon in the family of Old World monkeys. The species epithet means "dog-head" in Greek, due to the dog-like shape of the muzzle and head. Yellow baboons have slim bodies with long arms and legs along with yellowish-brown hair. They resemble the chacma baboon, but are somewhat smaller and with a less elongated muzzle. Their hairless faces are black, framed with white sideburns. Males can grow to about 84 cm, females to about 60 cm. They have long tails which grow to be nearly as long as their bodies. The average life span of the yellow baboon in the wild is roughly 15–20 years; some may live up to 30 years. <a href="https://www.worldlandtrust.org/species/mammals/yellow-baboon/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <li>American Alligator <span>(left)</span></li>
                <p>Both males and females have an "armored" body with a muscular, flat tail. The skin on their back is armored with embedded bony plates called osteoderms or scutes. They have four short legs; the front legs have five toes while the back legs have only four toes. Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth. The large, fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator fits into a socket in the upper jaw and is not visible when the mouth is closed. This does not happen in crocodiles. Alligators have between 74 and 80 teeth in their mouth at a time. As they wear down, they are replaced. An alligator can go through 3,000 teeth in a lifetime. <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Reptiles/American-Alligator" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <li>Black Caiman <span>(center)</span></li>
                <p>The black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) is a crocodilian reptile endemic to South America. With a maximum length of around 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft) and a mass of over 450 kg (1,000 lb), it is the largest living species of the family Alligatoridae, and the third-largest crocodilian in the Neotropical realm. True to its common and scientific names, the black caiman has a dark greenish-black coloration as an adult. In some individuals, the pigmentation can appear almost jet-black. It has grey to brown banding on the lower jaw; juveniles have a more vibrant coloration compared to adults, with prominent white-pale yellow banding on the flanks that remains present well into adulthood (more than most other species). The banding on young helps with camouflage by breaking up their body outline, on land or in water, in an effort to avoid predation. The morphology is quite different from other caimans but the bony ridge that occurs in other caimans is present. The head is large and heavy, an advantage in catching larger prey. Like all crocodilians, caimans are long, squat creatures, with big jaws, long tails and short legs. They have thick, scaled skin, and their eyes and noses are located on the tops of their heads. This enables them to see and breathe while the rest of their bodies are underwater. <a href="https://animalia.bio/black-caiman" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

                <p>The Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) is a medium-sized crocodilian found in South America. The most notable physical characteristic of this species is the broad snout derived from its name. The snout is well adapted to rip through the dense vegetation of the marshes. Due to this, these caimans swallow some of the dense vegetation while foraging for food. In the wild, adult Broad-snouted caimans normally grow to 2 to 2.5 m (6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 2 in) in length, but a few old males have been recorded to reach up to 3.5 m (11 ft). Captive adults were found to have weighed 29.2 to 62 kg (64 to 137 lb). Most tend to be of a light olive-green color. A few individuals have spots on their faces. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-snouted_caiman" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

        <section>		<!--I found the facts below very interesting and wanted to showcase them-->
        	<fieldset id="extra-info">
            <legend>Amazing facts that may suprise you!</legend>
            <h3>American Black Bear</h3>
            <p>They can eat over 10,000 berries in a day. When food is abundant, black bears will eat as much food as they possibly can, sometimes over 8kg of fruit and berries in a day.When berries and fruits are abundant, black bears will move to these areas and feed almost exclusively on these. 
            </p>
            <h3>Polar bears are not white</h3>
			<p>These bears have two layers of fur; the shorter undercoat and longer guard hairs. An often overlooked fact is that these hairs are translucent, however, they reflect sunlight which makes polar bears look white.
            </p>
            <h3>The brown bear is very smart</h3>
            <p>Cases have been recorded when these animals deliberately threw stones and branches into hunting traps in order to neutralize them.
            </p>
            <h3>West African Lions: It's the lioness who does the majority of the hunting</h3>
            <p>Most of the hunting is done by lionesses as they have to feed the members and cubs of the pride. Amazingly, they are superior hunters to lions. Their speed is 30% faster than the speed of the Lion, thanks to their lightweight and flexible body. A thinner body also allows them to remain hidden in the grass for longer, making it easier for them to hunt. Additionally, they collaborate to trap and catch their prey while employing cunning hunting strategies.
            </p>
            <h3>The Gelada Monkey have an unlikely alliance</h3> 
            <p>These monkeys have a very special relationship with the Ethiopian wolf. This species is endangered, and the geladas help them hunt, which increases their success. This is because the prey of these carnivorous animals are rodents. The gelada does not seem to gain any advantage from this relationship, which seems to indicate altruism or simple indifference.
            </p>
            <h3>Vervet Monkeys are extremely similar to humans</h3>
            <p>Although they’re just distant relatives in the grand scheme of things, vervet monkeys are actually a key factor in studying what it means to be human. Vervet monkeys make a perfect, nonhuman model to study genetics, behavior, and social factors. Vervet monkeys are vulnerable to a lot of the same conditions as humans. This includes hypertension, anxiety, and even alcohol use. They’ve also been a significant part of biomedical research in the world.
            </p>
            <h3>The Caiman Alligators have a strong sense of smell</h3>
			<p>The olfactory bulb—the portion of the brain responsible for smell—is quite prominent in the brains of caiman. Using this keen sense of smell, caimans can easily search and hunt for prey.
